## Week 1: Jan 6 - Jan 12

### Current Research on IBD

This section summarize the WES and GWAS studies on IBD, giving background information on the disease and current research on the diease. 

#### Disease Background

##### General Background of IBD

![](assets/image1.png){width="60%"}

- IBD is Chronic inflammation influenced by genetics, environment, microbiota, and immunity.

- Genetic Contribution

  - Crohn's Disease (CD): 15% family history; twin studies show 50% concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins vs. less than 10% in dizygotic (DZ) twins.

  - GWAS identified 163 loci; trans-ethnic studies identified an additional 38 loci.

- Epigenetics

  - Genome-environment interactions affect disease progression.

  - Emerging research focuses on the role of epigenetics in IBD.


##### Genetic Associations in IBD

- NOD2: First CD-associated gene (2001), with key variants R702W and G908R.

- Autophagy Genes: ATG16L1, LRRK2, and IRGM predispose individuals to IBD.

- IL-10 Receptor Mutations: IL10RA, IL10RB are linked to colitis.

- IBD-Associated Loci: ~240 loci identified (as of 2022); 30 shared between CD and UC.

- CD Predictive Loci: FOXO3, IGFBP1, and XACT as potential markers.

#### Large-Scale Exome Sequencing Identifies Novel Genes and Pathways in Crohn’s Disease

Sazonovs, Aleksejs et al.

##### Motivation

- CD is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a strong genetic component.

- GWAS has primarily focused on common variants, but rare coding variants remain under-explored.

##### Study Design

![](assets/image2.png){width="60%"}

##### Findings
- Single Variant Analysis: 94 out of 116 variants replicated in discovery datasets.

![](assets/image3.png){width="80%"}
![](assets/image4.png){width="60%"}


- Burden Test: Missense vs. frameshift variants analyzed.

![](assets/image5.png){width="90%"}


##### Takeaways

- Exome Sequencing Complements GWAS
  - Addresses gaps in genetic architecture (low-frequency and rare variants) that earlier CD GWAS
  meta-analyses could not observe.

- Significance of Coding Variants:
  - Coding variants, although fewer than noncoding variants, are highly enriched for associations with
  both common and rare diseases.
  - Tend to have stronger effects due to natural selection, which often keeps their frequencies low.
  - Provide direct links to specific genes and pathogenic mechanisms, unlike noncoding variants.

- Key Findings in CD Pathogenesis:
  - Novel genes such as PDLIM5, SDF2L1, HGFAC, PAF-R, and CCR7 emphasize the role of mesenchymal cells
  (MCs) in intestinal inflammation.

- Therapeutic Implications:
  - Findings highlight the potential for therapeutic strategies targeting mesenchymal niche balance to
  address CD pathogenesis.
  - Genetic evidence for drug targets is valuable for driving drug development.
  
- Future Directions:
  - Expanded sequencing efforts in ulcerative colitis and integrated analyses with larger GWAS studies
  are expected to identify more linked genes.

#### Genome-wide association study implicates immune activation of multiple integrin genes in inflammatory bowel disease

de Lange, K., Moutsianas, L., Lee, J. et al.

##### Motivation

- Current treatments involve immunomodulators, but patients often experience side effects or treatment resistance.

- GWAS and Immunochip studies have identified risk loci but have had limited therapeutic impact.

##### Study Design

![](assets/image6.png){width="90%"}


##### Findings
Identified 25 new GWAS loci

- 4 loci with significant variants
  - SLAMF8
  - RORC
  - PLCG2
  - NCF4
  
- Another 4 loci within integrin gene
  - 3 loci showed larger than 90% probability have colocalization with eQTL
  - 1 loci showed intermediate evidendence
  

##### Takeaways

- Integrins are not only important in cell trafficking but can also participate in cellular signaling.

- Highlighted integrins as key therapeutic targets:
  - Monoclonal antibodies like vedolizumab and etrolizumab targeting integrins have shown
  efficacy in IBD.
  - Identified SMAD7, a modulator of $TGF-\beta$ signaling, as a potential target for Crohn’s disease
  treatment.

- Emphasized the importance of gut-selective therapies to minimize risks like progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML).

- These discoveries have demonstrated that the effect sizes of GWAS associations do not necessarily
reflect the importance or therapeutic relevance of their underlying biological pathways.


### Method

#### Prioritizing disease-mediating genes leveraging trans-gene regulation

##### Motivation

- Complex Genetic Architecture of Diseases:
  - Complex traits are highly polygenic, involving numerous genes with varying effect sizes.
  - The omnigenic model posits that all expressed genes in disease-relevant tissues contribute to disease
  risk, but not all genes have equal importance.
  
- Importance of Disease-Mediating Genes:
  - Disease-associated genes can be categorized into:
    - Disease-mediating genes: Directly affect the disease.
    - Peripheral genes: Indirectly influence the disease through trans-regulatory networks.

  - Identifying disease-mediating genes is critical for uncovering pathways and mechanisms relevant to
  treatment development.

- Limitations of Current Gene Prioritization Methods:
  - GWAS:
    - Identifies important disease-mediating genes but may miss many due to lack of power in detecting
    low-frequency or rare variants with large effects.

  - Rare Variant Methods:
    - Gene-based approaches, like burden tests in WES, improve detection but are limited by current
    sample sizes.
    
  - Graph and Canonical Correlation Models:
    - Recent approaches predict candidate genes or link expressions to variants but fail to explicitly
    differentiate disease-mediating from peripheral genes or reveal trans-regulatory networks.

- Challenges with Cis-eQTLs in Disease Gene Discovery:
  - Disease genes often lack strong cis-QTL signals due to stronger selective constraints.
  - Cis-eQTL limitations necessitate focusing on trans-QTLs, as their target genes share similar
  selective constraints with disease genes.

- Significance of Trans-Regulation:
  - Trans-regulatory networks explain a large portion (~70%) of disease heritability.
  - Understanding trans-regulation provides insights into collaborative gene contributions to disease
  risk and highlights the importance of completing trans-gene regulatory networks for understanding
  complex trait genetics.

##### COTA
- COTA Model: Integrates trans-regulatory effects to identify disease-mediating genes.

- GBAT: Predicts gene expression using machine learning models.

![](assets/image7.png){width="80%"}

- DACT: Estimates gene effects from burden tests.


![](assets/image8.png){width="80%"}

##### Findings

- COTA enhances GWAS interpretability by revealing trans-regulatory networks.

- New gene discoveries provide insights into disease mechanisms.

- Potential for targeted therapy development based on genetic findings.

##### Code

- Codes for COTA are in [COTA Package.](https://github.com/mxxptian/COTA/tree/d211df91c43826ae56adfa30b39d506716921ba7)

- Summary of codes are in [code summary.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0V_S7Yh-XlwvDcbUzki3WhIxmeUiaPs_Eazlr4lhys/edit?tab=t.0)

##### EDA of data
- Basic visualizations of **p-values** were performed, including **QQ plots** and **histograms**, for burden tests involving **singleton** and **<0.001 NSYN/LoF variants** in **Crohn’s Disease (CD)**.  
  - The overall distribution of **p-values** for **CD with NSYN and LoF variants** appears nearly identical.  
  - Using a uniform distribution, the points predominantly align with the line, exhibiting slight curvature.
  
![](assets/image10.png){width="50%"}

![](assets/image11.png){width="50%"}

- Significant heterogeneity across all **nine studies** was assessed.  
  - Two genes met the significance threshold of **0.05/20,000** (**total genes: 18,641**):  
    - **SULT1A1 (Sulfotransferase Family 1A Member 1):** Encodes sulfotransferase enzymes that facilitate
    **sulfate conjugation** of various hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds.
    These cytosolic enzymes differ in **tissue distribution** and **substrate specificity**.  
    - **PLXND1 (Plexin D1):** Enables **protein domain-specific binding activity** and is involved in
    **axonogenesis regulation**, **semaphorin-plexin signaling**, and **synapse assembly**. Also plays a
    role in **circulatory system development**, **salivary gland branching**, and **kidney development**,
    and is primarily located in **lamellipodia**.  
  - The paper reported **43 sites** with significant heterogeneity, whereas only **two genes** were
  identified in this analysis.  
  - The original study applied a **heterogeneity-of-effect test** between the **Nextera** and **Twist
  discovery cohorts** using **IVW PHET < 0.0001** as the threshold.  
  - The discrepancy may be due to **differences in heterogeneity statistics** and a **more lenient
  p-value cutoff** in this analysis.  
  - When **0.0001** was used as the threshold, **32 genes** exhibited significant heterogeneity,
  including **SULT1A1 and PLXND1**.  

- **Basic summary of genes in the WES dataset**:  
  - **18,641 genes** are present in the dataset.  
  - **15,309 genes** are included in **all nine studies**.  
  - **3,332 genes** are shared across some but not all studies.  
  - In the **CD with NSYN 0.01 study**, **64 genes** lack **burden tests on singleton variants**.  
  - Some genes do not have variants that appear in only one sample.

### Discussion

#### Why most of burden tests significant genes are not detected by COTA

##### Check the overlap of burden tests significant genes and trans regulation target

- SNP based
  - 5 significant genes from the burden tests (AHNAK2, DNMT3A, NOD2, SBNO2, ATG4C) overlap with the trans-eQTL genes used for analysis. 
  
![](assets/image14.png){width="60%"}

![](assets/image15.png){width="60%"}

##### Check DGN matrix

There are still 5 significant burden test genes (AHNAK2, DNMT3A, NOD2, SBNO2, ATG4C) overlapped with DGN.

##### Check GTEx 

- Bulk gene expression have all the significant burden test genes.
